I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, with a keen interest in the intersection between computer science and economics. 

I did my undergrad in the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (<a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/">Yao Class</a>), Tsinghua University, where I was advised by <a href="https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/">Prof. Zhixuan Fang</a>. 
I visited <a href="https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/econcs-group">Harvard EconCS Group</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/">Prof. Yiling Chen</a> in 2022. 
Additionally, I undertook research internships at Microsoft Research Asia in 2023, hosted by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/siweiwang/">Siwei Wang</a>, and at Shanghai Qizhi Institute (2021), hosted by Zhixuan Fang. 
Throughout my undergraduate years, I also collaborated closely with <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Chongjie-Zhang.html">Prof. Chongjie Zhang</a>, <a href="https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/">Prof. Zhiyi Huang</a>, and <a href="https://www.haifeng-xu.com/">Prof. Haifeng Xu</a> during my undergraduate years.
