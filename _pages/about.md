I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Previously, I did my undergrad in the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (aka. <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/">Yao Class</a>) headed by Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao at Tsinghua University. At Tsinghua, I was very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/">Prof. Zhixuan Fang</a>. 
In Spring and Summer 2022, I visited Harvard EconCS Group under the supervision of <a href="https://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/">Prof. Yiling Chen</a>. 
I also had research internships at Microsoft Research Asia (2022-2023) and Shanghai Qizhi Institute (2021), where I worked closely with Siwei Wang and Zhixuan Fang.
